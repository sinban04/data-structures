# Single Linked List in C
Single Linked List is the linked list which has only one direction link.
We have the head of the list, and the nodes in the list.
Each node has the key and item, and 
there is only one node which has a specific key. (no duplicated key)
(In fact, this was made due to std::map in STL of Cplusplus)
